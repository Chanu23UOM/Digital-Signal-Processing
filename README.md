# Digital Signal Processing (DSP) Module Activities

Here I am uploading my Digital Signal Processing (DSP) module activities that I have completed so far.  
The purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and preserve my work so I can extend and implement them in future projects.

## 📂 Contents
- Jupyter/Colab notebooks (`.ipynb`)
- Python scripts (`.py`)
- Supporting files and experiments related to DSP concepts
- MATLAB and PS CAD files

## 🎯 Objectives
- Practice fundamental and advanced DSP concepts
- Build a resource for future implementation in real-world projects
- Document my learning journey in signal processing

## 🚀 Future Work
- Extend implementations for real-time DSP applications
- Explore integration with AI and ML for signal processing tasks
- Apply concepts in research and practical systems
